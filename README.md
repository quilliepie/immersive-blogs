# Immersive Blogs

## What is this Project?

### Origin

This is a _work-in-progress_ website, which I am creating to use as a way to share some of my personal experiences with the hopes of helping you, the reader, and others, to find peace, direction, and meaning in life.

I used to write regular blogs and share them online, but it didn't feel engaging enough. I felt that my writing alone wasn't enough to really _move_ those who read it—so, I thought about creating an _immersive_ blog website to share my blogs.

I've done a lot of spiritual work to connect with the person I am deep down, and I realized that my purpose in life is to use my creative abilities to spread love and empathy, and to be a light in others' lives to find peace through _presence._ I'm working a lot to maintain a living situation, and being able to work on projects like these with the time I have helps me create a fulfilling life.

While I want to do more than just create immersive blogs, this provides me with an outlet to be authentic and share my experiences in a way that is engaging, soothing, and fun.

1. **Disable/Enable Autoplay.** The blog will normally progress from start to finish without user input, though this can be disabled so that the user must click (or press a button) to continue after the current set of dialogue ends.
2. **Disable/Enable Immersion.**

## Mechanics

To have dynamic points, each immersive blog contains the following files:

- A `.md` (markdown) file containing the writing of the blog.
  - This website automatically separates sections of dialogue by checking the headers and text.
